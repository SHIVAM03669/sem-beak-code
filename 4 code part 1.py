# Given two strings s and t, return the number of distinct subsequences of s which equals t.

# The test cases are generated so that the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from s.
# rabbbit
# rabbbit
# rabbbit
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
# Output: 5
# Explanation:
# As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from s.
# babgbag
# babgbag
# babgbag
# babgbag
# babgbag
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000
# s and t consist of English letters.
